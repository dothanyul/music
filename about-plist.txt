plist is a Perl program to manage playlists, which are stored in the folder ~/Music/.playlists as folders of hardlinks (because I want to be able to have songs on a playlist that aren't in the main library, if I don't want an album that I only have one song on clogging up my library). It has functionality to create new playlists, rename existing playlists, view all playlists or all songs on a playlist, and add and remove songs from playlists.
The program prompts the user for names of playlists in ~/Music/.playlists or songs in ~/Music. When looking for songs, it searches directories to two levels deep (for ~/Music/artist/album/song, where the two levels are artist and album). It prints up to 10 things in the search directory that match the user input so far (e.g. if the user is looking for a song and types 'Joh', then it would print 'John Denver', 'John Hiatt', 'John Prine', and 'John Reischman & The Jaybirds'), which can be scrolled through all the matching options with the up and down arrows. Pressing tab autofills the longest prefix that matches all the matches (e.g. 'Joh' would extend to 'John ') or, if this wouldn't make the input any longer, it autofills the top item on the list (e.g. 'John ' would extend to 'John Denver' if you hadn't scrolled at all). Pressing delete deletes the whole input.
